<h1>Step 1 - MacOS (Apple Chip)</h1>
<h2>Preface: Good News and Bad News</h2>
<ul>
	<li>So...you got one of those shiny new(ish) Mac computers with Apple chip, eh?&nbsp;We've got some good news and
		bad news for you.&nbsp;<ul>
			<li>The good news:<ul>
					<li>&nbsp;Your python code will run blisteringly fast compared to a Mac with an Intel chip!&nbsp;
					</li>
					<li>Code that may take hours elsewhere will only take minutes for your computer.&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>The bad news:<ul>
					<li>Your instructions for Tool #3 below (the Python Distribution) are going to be very different
						than the other operating systems.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Additionally, there are still packages that have not yet been updated to be compatible with your
						processor.&nbsp;<ul>
							<li>But don't worry: everything that is in the other OS's dojo-env is also in yours!
								<br>Just a heads up if you go to install a new package and run into issues.
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h1>STEP # 1 INSTRUCTIONS:</h1>
<p>Note: steps for Tools # 1 and 2 are the same for Mac users with an Intel processor.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Tool #1: A Linux-based bash shell/terminal:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Linux users and MacOS users have this built-in to their OS.<ul>
			<li>On MacOS, the shell is called "Terminal" and can be found
				in&nbsp;<code>Applications&gt;Utilities</code>&nbsp;in Finder</li>
			<li>OR you can use spotlight search and search for "Terminal".</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Tool #2: GitHub&nbsp;Desktop</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Download the installer from this link:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub
			Desktop</a></li>
	<li>Once installation is complete, open the application.<ul>
			<li>Log into the same GitHub account you have been using for your projects.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Once you have logged into the app,&nbsp; open the Options menu<ul>
			<li>&nbsp;Select&nbsp;<code>"GitHub Desktop"</code>&nbsp;on the menu bar (top of the screen) and then
				select&nbsp;<code>Preferences</code>.</li>
			<li>Select the "Integrations" tab.</li>
			<li>Make sure the Shell dropdown menu says GitBash<ul>
					<li>If not, select it from the dropdown menu.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Click Save.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
</p>
<blockquote><strong>Note: Here is where the instructions for Apple Chips will significantly deviate from the
		others.<br></strong></blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>primary difference</strong>&nbsp;is that in order for us to use Apple-Chip compatible versions of
		packages (like TensorFlow),&nbsp;<strong>we CAN NOT use the standard Anaconda distribution.&nbsp;</strong></li>
	<li>There is a l<strong>ightweight alternative to Anaconda, called miniforge</strong>, that will install much of the
		<strong>same foundations as Anaconda,</strong> but with&nbsp;access to alternative versions of
		packages&nbsp;that are optimized for Apple Chips.<ul>
			<li><strong>Note/Warning: you would still be&nbsp;<em>able</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;to install Anaconda if
					you tried, but</strong> your computer will <strong>never</strong> be able to run TensorFlow if you
				use Anaconda. So please, take our word for it that it is worth following our alternative
				instructions&nbsp;</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li>The following instructions are based on <a
			href="https://caffeinedev.medium.com/how-to-install-tensorflow-on-m1-mac-8e9b91d93706" target="_blank">this
			blog post</a>, should you wish to review it in-depth.<span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Tool #3: Python&nbsp;Distribution - miniforge</h2>
<p>Tool # 3 will involve several steps with several verification steps along the way. Make sure to follow each Step and
	Verification step below to ensure you have a problem-free python installation.</p>
<h3>Step 1: Install XCode&nbsp;(a Mac-specific developer toolkit from Apple)</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Run the command below in your Terminal.<ul>
			<li>Note: this step may take several minutes&nbsp;</li>
			<li>You may be asked to enter your password to approve the installation.&nbsp;This is your normal user
				password to log into your computer.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">xcode-select --install</pre>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2: Install Homebrew&nbsp; ( a database of downloadable apps/tools for Mac)</h3>
<p>Visit&nbsp;<a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">https://brew.sh/</a>&nbsp;for more information about Homebrew
</p>
<ul>
	<li>To Install homebrew, run the following command in your Terminal (and make sure to read the steps below):</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby"
	class="rainbow">/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"</pre>
<ul>
	<li><strong>You may be asked to enter your password in your terminal.</strong>&nbsp;<ul>
			<li>This is the same password you use to log into your mac.&nbsp;</li>
			<li>Enter your password when prompted and hit Enter.&nbsp;<ul>
					<li>NOTE: You will not be able to see what keys you have typed, so just trust that it is recognizing
						your keystrokes and hit enter. It will notify you if the password was incorrect.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>The installation process will pause and ask you "Press RETURN to continue or any other key to
			abort".</strong>&nbsp;<ul>
			<li>When it does, press Return/Enter!</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Step 2B: CRITICAL NOTE</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>When homebrew has finished installing, it may display a message telling you to run 1 or 2 commands in
				your Terminal.&nbsp;<ul>
					<li><strong>It is very important that you run those commands</strong>, otherwise, your terminal will
						not know that homebrew has been installed.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 2&nbsp;Verification:</h3>
<p>Confirm that homebrew was successfully installed:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>&nbsp;Open a New Terminal Window (shortcut: Cmd+N or Cmd+T) and run the "brew" command</strong>.&nbsp;
		<ul>
			<li>If it lists available commands, great!<ul>
					<li>&nbsp; You're all set to move forward.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>If it says brew not found,&nbsp;</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>You may have missed the commands to paste at the end of the homebrew installation.</li>
					<li>Try installing homebrew again and make sure to pay attention to the final text that's displayed
						and follow any additional instructions it displays.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h2>Step 3: Install miniforge using homebrew.</h2>
<h3>Pre-Step 3 Verification:</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>VERIFY THAT ANACONDA HAS NEVER BEEN PREVIOUSLY INSTALLED ON YOUR COMPUTER&nbsp;&nbsp;BY ANY
			USER.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Open a terminal window and run the "conda" command (without quotation marks).&nbsp;<ul>
					<li>If it says conda not found, great!&nbsp;<ul>
							<li>You're ready to install miniforge.&nbsp;</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>If it shows a list of available conda commands:<ul>
							<li><strong>You&nbsp;MUST FOLLOW THE APPENDIX INSTRUCTIONS AT THE BOTTOM FOR "Uninstalling
									Anaconda"</strong></li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	<font color="#3e4e5a" face="Gotham-Rounded-Bold"><span></span></font>
</p>
<ul>
	<li><dfn><dfn></dfn></dfn><dfn>CRITICAL NOTE:&nbsp;</dfn>
		<ul>
			<li><dfn>IF YOUR TERMINAL RECOGNIZED THE CONDA COMMAND&nbsp;</dfn><b>ANACONDA MUST BE REMOVED BEFORE
					INSTALLING MINIFORGE.&nbsp;</b></li>
			<li>Failure to heed this warning will break all of your python environments and it is NOT easy to fix!!!
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Step 3 Commands:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Enter the brew installation command below in your terminal:</li>
</ul>
<div>
	<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">brew install miniforge</pre>
	<ul>
		<li>Once miniforge has finished installing, run the following command in your terminal (required for
			Matplotlib):</li>
	</ul>
	<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">brew install pkg-config</pre>
	<h3>Post-Step 3 Verification</h3>
</div>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Open a new terminal window and enter the "conda" command.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>If it lists available commands, fantastic!!&nbsp;<ul>
					<li><strong>You are all set to move on to the next page of instructions&nbsp;"2. Setting Up Your
							dojo-env Environment"!!</strong></li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>If it says conda not found, try restarting your computer and then try running the conda command again.
				<ul>
					<li>If it still says conda not found, reach out to your instructor or a TA for help&nbsp;ASAP.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

</p>
<h2>APPENDIX: UNINSTALLING ANACONDA</h2>
<p>If your computer already knew the conda command during "Pre-Step 3 Verification", it is critical that you remove
	anaconda before continuing with the miniforge installation.</p>
<p><strong>Pre-Uninstallation Verification Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you share your computer with another User who also uses Python:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Pause here and check with them BEFORE you uninstall anaconda.&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>You will be removing
					all of their python environments too,</strong> even though they have a separate User account.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you share your computer with someone and they have concerns about uninstalling
			anaconda:&nbsp;</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Stop here (for now)</strong>.<ul>
					<li>Do not move forward with the instructions until you have spoken with your instructor.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>Your instructor may be able to address concerns that your fellow User has and convince them to
						let you install miniforge.&nbsp;</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Alternatively, you could follow the Step 1 - MacOS (Intel Processor) instructions instead but:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Your python code will run slower than it would with miniforge.</li>
			<li>You will not be able to import tensorflow without your kernel crashing.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Your instructor may be able to address concerns that your fellow User has and convince them to let you install
		miniforge.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<h4>Official&nbsp;Steps for Fully Uninstalling Anaconda:</h4>
<p>The following steps are taken directly from the <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/"
		target="_blank">Official&nbsp;Uninstalling Anaconda documentation page</a>, specifically "Option B. Full
	uninstall using Anaconda-Clean and simple remove."</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Install the Anaconda-Clean package from Anaconda Prompt (terminal on Linux or macOS):</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">conda install anaconda-clean</pre>
<ul>
	<li>In the same window, run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">anaconda-clean --yes</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Once the process has been completed, manually delete any "anaconda3" or "anaconda2" folders that still
		exist.&nbsp;<ul>
			<li>It may be located in one of several&nbsp;possible folders. Run the following "ls -a" commands until you
				see a folder called "anconda2" or "anaconda3".&nbsp;</li>
			<li><strong>Once you see an anaconda folder, take note of:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>&nbsp;Which command showed the folder.</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><strong>&nbsp;Specifically, what did the command say after "ls -a"&nbsp;</strong></li>
							<li>We will refer to this as your "base folder" in the final step.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>If the anaconda folder was "anconda2" or "anaconda3"</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>We will refer to this as your "anaconda folder" in the final step.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>and j</strong>ump to the very last command at the bottom of the page, with those 2 pieces of
				information.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">ls -a ~/
ls -a ~/opt/
ls -a /opt/</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Run the final command to remove the anaconda folder once you've identified your "base folder" and "anaconda
		folder".<ul>
			<li>Replace {base_folder} with the actual folder name</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Replace {anaconda_folder} with the actual folder name.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">rm -rf {base_folder}{anaconda_folder}
</pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once you've replaced the placeholder folder names with your actual folder names, the command should look something
	like this:</p>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3
# or 
rm -rf ~/anaconda2
# or 
rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3</pre>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Final Verification&nbsp;Step:</h4>
<ul>
	<li>Now, open a <strong>new</strong> terminal window and try running the "conda" command again. Your terminal should
		say that conda is not found.<ul>
			<li>If it says conda is not found, you are now ready to jump back up to the "Step 3 Commands" header above.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>If your computer still displays a list of conda commands, see the final portion of the <a
					href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/#removing-anaconda-path-from-bash-profile"
					target="_blank">Official Uninstallation Instructions "Removing Anaconda from
					.bash_profile"</a>&nbsp; <strong>You may want to contact your instructor if you do not understand
					the final instructions in the official instructions.</strong></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
