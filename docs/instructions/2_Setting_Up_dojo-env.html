<h1>2. Setting Up Your dojo-env Environment</h1>
<h2>Step 2 Overview:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>In Step 1, we installed the foundational tools needed for our local python installation.&nbsp;</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>While we did install a Python distribution with a basic copy of Python (Anaconda or miniforge), we have
                not installed all of the packages and tools that we need as data scientists.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>In Step 2, you will be creating a custom python environment called "dojo-env".&nbsp;</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>An "environment" is a bundle of specific python packages that are used together.</strong>
                Importantly, an environment specifies specific version #'s of the packages to ensure that all of the
                versions installed are mutually compatible.</li>
            <li><strong>You can install many environments</strong> on your computer and switch between them as needed
                for different projects.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>We have designed the dojo-env to include everything you'd need for our program</strong>, so you
                may not have a reason to add additional environments.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>Currently Supported Operating Systems</h3>
<h3></h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>We have prepared environment files (.yml files) for 3 different OS configurations:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Windows (10 &amp; 11)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Mac (with Intel processors)</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Mac (Apple Chips).&nbsp;<br></strong></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>&nbsp;Reminder for mac users:&nbsp;&nbsp;<ul>
            <li>Please revisit the "1.&nbsp;Downloading and Installing Apps" lesson if you are not sure which type of
                mac you are using.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Note to Linux Users:<ul>
            <li>Sorry Linux users! A Linux machine was not available for testing during the development of the
                dojo-env.&nbsp;</li>
            <li>If you are willing to work with an instructor to develop and test a Linux version of dojo-env, contact
                your instructor or send an email to jirving@codingdojo.com requesting assistance in create a linux
                version of dojo-env.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>The environment files (and a backup of these instructions) are in the dojo-env-setup repository</strong>
        (<a
            href="https://github.com/coding-dojo-data-science/dojo-env-setup">https://github.com/coding-dojo-data-science/dojo-env-setup</a>)
        <ul>
            <li>The Detailed Instructions below will guide you through how to clone and use the environment setup
                repository.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Brief Summary of the Following Steps:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Step 2.1:&nbsp; Clone the dojo-env-setup repository</li>
    <li>Step 2.2:&nbsp;Open the repo in your terminal/GitBash</li>
    <li>Step 2.3:&nbsp;Create the dojo-env environment</li>
    <li>Step 2.4: Setting dojo-env as your default.</li>
