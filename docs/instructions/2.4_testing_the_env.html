</p>
<p></p>
<p>To test that your installation and packages are working properly. We are going to run a specific Environment Testing
	notebook that is also located in the "dojo-env-setup" folder.</p>
<h2>Running the environment tester notebook with jupyter notebook</h2>
<ul>
	<li>From the same terminal window,&nbsp;start jupyter notebook&nbsp;(run&nbsp;<code>jupyter notebook</code>&nbsp;in
		your terminal)&nbsp;<ul>
			<li>A new tab should open in your web browser that shows the File view for jupyter notebook.</li>
			<li>You should see all of the files that were in the dojo-env-folder.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><dfn style="color: rgb(192, 80, 77);">TO DO: ADD SCREENSHOT HERE</dfn></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>There are 2 "EnvironmentTester"&nbsp;notebooks:<ul>
			<li>"EnvironmentTester-mac.ipynb" for macs&nbsp;(both Intel and Apple Chip macs)</li>
			<li>"EnvironmentTester-windows.ipynb"&nbsp;for Windows.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Click on the test notebook for your OS to open it.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Once the notebook interface has loaded, you should see a toolbar with several menu choices.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><dfn style="color: rgb(192, 80, 77);">TO DO: ADD SCREENSHOT</dfn></strong></p>
<ul>
	<li>We want to run all of the cells in this notebook and confirm it can make it to the end without errors.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>To Run the Entire Notebook:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Select the "Kernel" Menu &gt; "Restart and Run All"</strong></li>
			<li><strong>Wait patiently.&nbsp;</strong>The testing notebook is going to run through several modeling and
				EDA steps to confirm that the packages are working correctly.&nbsp;<ul>
					<li>This could take anywhere from 2-10 minutes to run.&nbsp;</li>
					<li>You will see the web browser tab icon turn to an hourglass when the notebook is running and back
						to an orange notebook icon when it is done.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Scroll down to the bottom of the notebook and confirm the cells have run:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Check if the very last cell printed the success message.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If the entire notebook ran successfully</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Congrats! Your dojo-env is fully functional and you can move on to the next step/lesson!</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>I<strong>f your notebook did not run the entire notebook successfully:</strong>
